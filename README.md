# Machine-Learning_IN4320
This repository contains the 7 projects that we implemented in Python (in form of Jupyter notebooks) and in MATLAB under the course Machine Learning during the MSc in Computer Science (Data Science specialization) at TU Delft the period 2017-2018

The topics that we investigated were:

# 1) Regularization
# 2) Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
# 3) Online Learning
# 4) Reinforcement Learning
# 5) Computational Learning
# 6) Multiple Instance Learning
# 7) Active Learning
