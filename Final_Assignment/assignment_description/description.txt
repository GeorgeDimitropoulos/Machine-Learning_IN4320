In this work, we deal with a two-class classification problem in 204 dimensions, where we are given
a small labeled train set and a large unlabeled test that has undergone a corruption of some sort in
the form of additive uniform noise. Our goal is to implement the best performing classifier on the
unlabeled data in terms of the error on this test set. Our approach is based on an Active Learning
approach.
